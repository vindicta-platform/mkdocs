## Platform Integration

This documentation site serves as the **public face** of the Vindicta Platform. Individual repositories maintain their own `docs/` folders for:

- Repository-specific ADRs
- Setup and contribution guides
- API documentation specific to that package

The Platform-Docs site aggregates and presents platform-wide concerns only.
