# Army Management

Map units to IDs and record game actions with WARScribe notation.

---

## Overview

Vindicta's army management uses the **WARScribe** notation format — a human-readable, machine-parseable standard for representing Warhammer 40k **game actions and unit references**.

!!! warning "Scope Clarification"
    WARScribe is **not** a list validation tool. It maps unit makeup to IDs and records gameplay actions. List legality validation is **out of scope** — this is an accepted risk for future projects that may rely on this data.

## What WARScribe Does

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Unit ID mapping | Point limit validation |
| Action notation | Detachment legality |
| Game event recording | Loadout rule enforcement |
| Transcript generation | Faction restrictions |

## Unit Registration

Register your units for a match:

```bash
vindicta warscribe register \
  --unit "Captain" \
  --id "CPT-01" # May be autogenerated if not provided
```

Units are tracked by their assigned IDs throughout the game.

## Action Notation

Record game actions in WARScribe format:

```
[MOVE: CPT-01 -> Objective-1]
[SHOOT: TNK-02 -> CPT-01]
[CHARGE: TAC-03 -> OBJ-1]
[FIGHT: CPT-01 -> Objective-5]
```

## Transcript Generation

After a game, generate a complete transcript:

```bash
vindicta warscribe transcript <match-id>
```

Output:

```
=== Turn 1 ===
[MOVE: CPT-01 -> Zone-A]
[SHOOT: TNK-02 -> CPT-01, Result: 3 wounds]

=== Turn 2 ===
[CHARGE: TAC-03 -> OBJ-1, Success]
...
```

## Known Gaps

!!! info "Accepted Risk"
    Lists may declare units that are mechanically illegal according to game rules. Future projects needing list validation will require a separate validation layer. This is documented as an **open risk**.
