# Vindicta Platform

**The unified competitive Warhammer 40k platform.**

## What is Vindicta?

Vindicta is a comprehensive platform for competitive Warhammer 40k players, tournament organizers, and meta analysts. It provides tools for:

- **Army Management** — Build, validate, and share army lists
- **Match Tracking** — Log games, track scores, and record key moments
- **Meta Analysis** — Discover trending builds and undervalued "sleeper" lists
- **AI Predictions** — Get win probability estimates and tactical insights

## Philosophy

Vindicta is built on three core principles:

### 🎯 Mechanical Fidelity

Every rule is implemented exactly as written. No shortcuts, no approximations. When the platform says a unit has a certain ability, it works exactly like it does on the tabletop.

### 💰 Free Tier First

The entire platform runs on GCP Free Tier. No credit card required. No monthly fees. If you're playing competitively, you shouldn't have to pay for basic tools.

### 🔓 Open Architecture

All components are open source and modular. Use the whole platform, or just the pieces you need. Host it yourself, or use our hosted version.
